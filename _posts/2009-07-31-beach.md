### 大部分的狠角色都有自己的模式；打破那個模式，就可以做掉他。

> Close your eyes and think about a lagoon hidden from the sea and passing boats by a high, curving wall of rock. Then imagine idyllic white sands and coral gardens. Waterfalls surrounded by thick jungle. Plants untouched for a thousand years, strangely colored birds and monkeys in the trees. On the white sands, fishing in the coral gardens, is a select group of travelers. They leave if they want to, they return, the beach never changes.
